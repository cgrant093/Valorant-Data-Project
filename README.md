# Valorant-Data-Science-Project
Valorant is a 5v5 first-person tactile shooter game. Where the players choose different agents with unique abilities. Valorant has tried to handle it's cheating problem with anti-cheat software, but this does about it's 'smurfing' problem. I wanted to collect statistics on accounts vs the rank they are given. Clean the data. See if it's plausible to create a model of given your stats vs rank. And when a user is a suspected smurf, see if we can compare their average stats to the ones for the given rank and run some statistic tests to get a confidence level of whether or not they are in the correct rank.
